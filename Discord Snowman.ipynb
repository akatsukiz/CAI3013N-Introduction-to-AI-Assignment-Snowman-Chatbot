When Oliver Cromwell and his Puritan forces took over England in 1645, they were on a mission to rid England of decadence. As part of their grand plan, they decided to do the unthinkable – cancel Christmas! 😱❌ But fear not, for the holiday spirit prevailed! By popular demand, Charles II was restored to the throne, and with him, the triumphant return of our beloved Christmas. 🎉👑 Across the Atlantic, the pilgrims, those English trailblazers who journeyed to America in 1620, were even more steadfast in their Puritan beliefs than Cromwell. 🚢💼 Interestingly, Christmas wasn't exactly a holiday affair in early America. 😮🇺🇸 From 1659 to 1681, the good folks in Boston went as far as outlawing the celebration of Christmas! 🚫🎅 Anyone caught spreading Christmas cheer risked a fine of five shillings. Quite the contrast to the Jamestown settlement, where Captain John Smith reported a jolly good time with Christmas celebrations going off without a hitch! 🎊🌟 Now, after the rollercoaster ride of the American Revolution, English customs, including our cherished Christmas, fell out of favor for a bit. 🎢🇺🇸 In fact, Christmas wasn't officially declared a federal holiday until June 26, 1870! 🗓️🎇 But fear not, for Christmas has stood the test of time, proving that not even cancellation attempts can dim the twinkle of its festive lights! ✨🎄🎁\",\n",

Christmas provided families with a day when they could lavish attention—and gifts—on their children without appearing to 'spoil' them. 🎁👶 As Americans began to embrace Christmas as a perfect family holiday, old customs were unearthed. People looked toward recent immigrants and Catholic and Episcopalian churches to see how the day should be celebrated. 🕊️⛪ In the next 100 years, Americans built a Christmas tradition all their own that included pieces of many other customs, including decorating trees, sending holiday cards, and gift-giving. 🎄🎁 Although most families quickly bought into the idea that they were celebrating Christmas how it had been done for centuries, Americans had really re-invented a holiday to fill the cultural needs of a growing nation. 🇺🇸❤️🌲\",\n",

D. 280. 🇹🇷 St. Nicholas gave away all of his inherited wealth and traveled the countryside helping the poor and sick, becoming known as the protector of children and sailors. 🎁⚓ St. Nicholas first entered American popular culture in the late 18th century in New York, when Dutch families gathered to honor the anniversary of the death of 'Sint Nikolaas' (Dutch for Saint Nicholas), or 'Sinter Klaas' for short. 🇳🇱🎉 'Santa Claus' draws his name from this abbreviation. 🎅🏻✉️ In 1822, Episcopal minister Clement Clarke Moore wrote a Christmas poem called 'An Account of a Visit from St. Nicholas,' more popularly known today by its first line: '‘Twas The Night Before Christmas.' 📜🌙 The poem depicted Santa Claus as a jolly man who flies from home to home on a sled driven by reindeer to deliver toys. 🦌🛷 The iconic version of Santa Claus as a jolly man in red with a white beard and a sack of toys was immortalized in 1881, when political cartoonist Thomas Nast drew on Moore's poem to create the image of Old Saint Nick we know today. 🎨🌲🎁\",\n",
